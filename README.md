# Project Overview

This project focuses on comparing how different ML models predict loan approvals based on given data. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset). This project allowed me to experiment with a few different ML models and compare their performance. I also created an app where you can provide your data and recieve a prediction for a loan approval using the model that performed the best. 

## Project Goals

- **Explore different machine learning models** to determine which ones have the highest accuracy when making predictions.
- **Explore the effect of resampling**, compare the model precision with and without sampling
- **Create a usable app** using streamlit, this allows my findings to be used by others. 


## Steps Involved

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for model training, exploring the dataset and
2. **Resampling**: Resampling to account for minority and comparing the precision with/ without resampling to see it's effect.
3. **Model Training**: Train multiple models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier (RFC), with the intent of comparing their precision and using the best one
4. **Streamlit App**: Creating a Streamlit app that allows users to input their data and receieve a loan approval prediction
